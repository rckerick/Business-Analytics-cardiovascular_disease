# Business Analytics for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in patients using business analytics and advanced machine learning techniques. The project addresses challenges like class imbalance through **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** and hyperparameter optimization, leveraging the power of a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction. Key insights, feature importance, and recommendations for deployment in real-world hospital settings are provided.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline to handle missing data, categorical encoding, and class imbalance.
- Implementation of **SMOTE** and **Class Weighting** for imbalanced data.
- Hyperparameter optimization using **GridSearchCV**.
- Evaluation of metrics like **Recall**, **Precision**, **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, and **AUC**.
- Feature importance analysis using Random Forest.
- Recommendations for deploying the model in hospital settings.
